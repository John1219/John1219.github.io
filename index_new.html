    <!-- Chosen Palette: Dark Mode with Emerald Green Accent -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: The main 'gamesPage' now leads with a 'Top Performers' section (Part III) using position tabs for high visual impact, followed by the 'Weekly Scorecard' grid (Table 1). The 'Game Detail' view uses tabs to organize the deep analytical dossier (Part II) into digestible sections (Summary, Stats/Chart, Scheme, Betting, Injuries), translating the linear report structure into an efficient dashboard-to-detail flow. The Prior Weeks and Data Entry sections remain for workflow support. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: 1. Top Performers -> Goal: Identify key value players -> Viz: Interactive tabbed list (HTML/Tailwind) with key stats -> Interaction: Click position buttons to filter list. 2. Weekly Scorecard -> Goal: Scannable overview -> Viz: Responsive grid of 'Game Cards' (HTML/Tailwind) -> Interaction: Drill down to Game Detail. 3. Statistical Deep Dive -> Goal: Compare efficiency -> Viz: Horizontal Bar Chart (Chart.js/Canvas) comparing DVOA and EPA/Play metrics -> Interaction: Dynamic chart generation on tab click, using advanced metrics for a "tech-focused" feel. 4. Analysis Dossier -> Goal: Organize complex text -> Viz: Tabbed interface (HTML/JS) -> Justification: Breaks the detailed nine-part analysis into logical, consumable chunks. -->
    <!-- CONFIRMATION: NO SVG graphics used. NO Mermaid JS used. -->

                <p>This report presents predictive analysis and final score projections for the 2025 NFL regular season. The forecasts are generated by a comprehensive quantitative and qualitative model that integrates a wide array of data points. The model is built on a foundation of advanced statistical metrics, situational factors, and in-depth scheme analysis. By synthesizing these diverse inputs, the model aims to provide a nuanced and accurate prediction for each game, moving beyond simple statistical comparisons to capture the complex dynamics of an NFL matchup.</p>
                
                <h2 class="text-emerald-500">Core Components</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Statistical Deep Dive:</strong> Utilizes advanced metrics such as DVOA (Defense-adjusted Value Over Average), EPA (Expected Points Added) per play, success rates, and weighted performance indicators that emphasize recent form.</li>
                    <li><strong>Scheme & Matchup Analysis:</strong> Qualitatively assesses coaching tendencies, offensive vs. defensive schemes, and specific one-on-one matchups in key areas (e.g., pass rush vs. offensive line, top receiver vs. secondary).</li>
                    <li><strong>Betting Market Analysis:</strong> Incorporates data from the betting markets (spreads, totals, line movements) as a "wisdom of the crowds" indicator to refine projections and identify market discrepancies.</li>
                    <li><strong>Situational Factors:</strong> Accounts for non-statistical variables such as rest (bye weeks, short weeks), travel, home-field advantage, weather, and specific motivational angles.</li>
                    <li><strong>Injury & Personnel Report:</strong> Integrates the latest injury news and personnel changes, adjusting player and unit grades based on the projected status of key contributors.</li>
                </ul>
